reminders -------------------------------------------------
  -any bottlenecks likely come from the deal-handling branch
  -must call store.dispatch(new SetIsFilterSame(false)) before calling searchService.setCurrentlyDisplayingGames();

known bugs --------------------------
  -Deal 1 trick 6 of yougurt 2/16 7:24pm bug where order of playing is reversed (it seems to be an issue with the deal and how it was saved)
  -deleting games in localStorage will break the app if users isn't also deleted

Known Quirks-----------------
  -since users can change username and email, the user has to know the current username or email in order to get results (would have to keep track user username changes on A# maj bridge to remedy )

Optimizations------------------------------------------------------
  -need to keep track of how many times each userId is queried and use that info to remove the least queried usernames when space runs short (add a check in every localStorageManager method that saves which checks space available and basically deletes the minimal amount of 'least valuable' localStorage data as possible)
  -need a function to remove the oldest localStorageUser by last access date and call when storage is full or approaching it

Prettification-------------------
  -game-detail__score width is a bit 'off'
  -bolden the high cards ("A, k q j") in table
  -add hcp and dist points to hands table?

Todos----------------------------------------------------------
  -figure out how to move landing service validators to a new service folder in the frontend project in a ValidatorsService file

-figure out how to make closing deal-player reset everything
-add goto nth card played text box?
-add 'Deal Pass out' filter?
-add 'Deal split' filter? (finds games where winning team won by x number of deals)
