known bugs --------------------------
  -Deal 1 trick 6 of yougurt 2/16 7:24pm bug where order of playing is reversed (it seems to be an issue with the deal and how it was saved)
  -sluggish resize and no card reset when opening one deal in a game, then resize, then open another (doesn't seems to be from deal-player.service migration)


Known Quirks-----------------
  -since users can change username and email, the user has to know the current username or email in order to get results (would have to keep track user username changes on A# maj bridge to remedy )


Components:
  1. UserInputs (inputs for username and email, input for filter before and filter after (three ways to use: get games before date, after date, or between dates), dropdown to select nth page to view when more than specified-amount-to-view-per-page number of games available

Optimizations------------------------------------------------------
  -store the gamecount for the user and see if it matches the stored value, if so then no need to pull any more, if not, pull and store all games in localstorage?
  -figure out how to sensibly cache looked up games into local storage and then when making new requests, check last search date for that userId/email and send a request to only get games since that date. 
    -could have localStorage item 'queriesByName' and 'queriesByEmail: 
    {
      'username' : {
        date: Date.now(),
        games: localStorage.getItem('games')[username]
      }
    }
    (need both email and username versions?)
    {
      'email' : {
        date: Date.now(),
        games: localStorage.getItem('games')[username]
      }
    }
    -then have a separate games item where the actual games are stored:
    {
      'username': Game[]
    }
  -cache looked up deals (executed in DealsList) in a similar fashion
  -cache userObjs too (have to get 4 for each game)

Prettification-------------------
  -game-detail__score width is a bit 'off'
  -bolden the high cards ("A, k q j") in table
  -use deals-list dealResults to change deal-detail table username color (winners = green and losers = red)
  -change deal-detail__summary-text to red or green depending on if declarer won it.

Todos----------------------------------------------------------
  -landing reset button is messed up (disabled when valid email and no username for example)
  -Add threejs nebular to landing
  -add ngIf to email and username fields (hide the other if one is valid)
  -figure out how to move landing service validators to a new service folder in the frontend project in a ValidatorsService file

  Game Filtering stuff----------------------------------------
  -add filter by room name option for the GameList
  -add sorting options for gameslist (ascending / descending by date and name)
  -add show games between date
  -add show games played with another player or players





-figure out how to make closing deal-player reset everything

-add goto nth card played text box?
-change how deal winners works (always show 14 columns)

Testing------------
  -test already stored LocalStorageUser scenario works
  -how does providing email to a localStorageUser already present work? does it save email?




-need a function to remove the oldest localStorageUser by last access date and call when storage is full or approaching it

-add a toggle/checkbox to toggle/choose the height of game-detail (3.2rem or what it is now) and is also sets game-detail__summary height to 100%;  maybe call is 'size' and use a dropdown to the left or right of title;  also store a value in localstorage to keep track of users last selected choice (which loads on redirect to /games).
