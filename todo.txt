Desired Flow:
  1. get user ID from local storage if available otherwise from mongodb atlas server and then store in local storage
      (the function that retrieves the user ID from atlas can accept either an email or username: '/api/getId?name=...' or 'api/getId?email=...'
  2. user id is used to retrieve the 10 most recent games that user has played (store games in local storage with key being iso date)
  3. deal info is fetched when user clicks 'load' next to the deal they want to load in the DealList
  * include a game summary containing relavent game info
  * display all relevant details of the game in an expanding box within the game's deal list (maybe make game's deal list a table?)
  *Would need to mkake a query that has the total number of games that user has for pagination purposes (then store in local storage);  Maybe can make one query that does that and gets the first page of game?


Components:
  1. PageContainer
  2. UserInputs (inputs for username and email, input for filter before and filter after (three ways to use: get games before date, after date, or between dates), dropdown to select nth page to view when more than specified-amount-to-view-per-page number of games available
  3. GameList (displays the list of games and makes request regarding games to backend)
  3.1. GameDetail (dumb component that has Input() of game and a template for the game)
  4. DealList (each GameDetail has one DealList;  displays the list of deals for a game and makes requests regarding deals to backend)
  4.1. DealDetail (dumb component that has Input() of deal and a template for the deal)
  

-add filter by room name option for the GameList
-add sorting options for gameslist (ascending / descending by date and name)
-add show games between date
-add show games played with another player or players

-landing reset button is messed up (disabled when valid email and no username for example)
-Add threejs nebular to landing
-add ngIf to email and username fields (hide the other if one is valid)
-figure out how to move landing service validators to a new service folder in the frontend project in a ValidatorsService file

-figure out how to sensibly cache looked up games into local storage and then when making new requests, check last search date for that userId/email and send a request to only get games since that date. 
  -could have localStorage item 'queriesByName' and 'queriesByEmail: 
  {
    'username' : {
      date: Date.now(),
      games: localStorage.getItem('games')[username]
    }
  }
  (need both email and username versions?)
  {
    'email' : {
      date: Date.now(),
      games: localStorage.getItem('games')[username]
    }
  }
  -then have a separate games item where the actual games are stored:
  {
    'username': Game[]
  }
-cache looked up deals (executed in DealsList) in a similar fashion
-cache userObjs too (have to get 4 for each game)

-make usernames in gamedetail a button that pulls up a page on that user (at least add data property with userID)?
-add get controller to get username from id (need to have gamesdetail handle and store?)
-add controller to get number of games userId has using '{players: ObjectId("602215786180a2c060662af7")}' on GameModel

-Finish GamesList styling (figure out why )
-DealsList shows up when a button on GameDetail "Show Deals" is pressed (DealsList makes backend call to get deals and puts in store)
-Pass deals in each GameDetail to DealsList
-finish the deal viewing stuff
-how hard would it be to make deal-detail be a table with names across top and suits along left side?
-finish deal summary message
-convert contract to an imgHTML

-finish deal count (3 deals to 0)
-change view details button to be absolutely positioned in the game-detail container and have hover of container show it.
-bolden the high cards ("A, k q j") in table
-need to add a bidding table to deal-detail

-full-screen deal-detail: add click outside box of closes
-use deals-list dealResults to change deal-detail table username color (winners = green and losers = red)
-change deal-detal__summary-text to red or green depending on if declarer won it.
-work on responsive styling for full-size game-detail

-make bidding table (have 'tableWidth' of 4 and have three actions in for loop depending on i < = > tableWidth)
