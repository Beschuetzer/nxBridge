reminders -------------------------------------------------
  -any bottlenecks likely come from the deal-handling branch
  -must call store.dispatch(new SetIsFilterSame(false)) before calling searchService.setCurrentlyDisplayingGames();

known bugs --------------------------
  -Deal 1 trick 6 of yougurt 2/16 7:24pm bug where order of playing is reversed (it seems to be an issue with the deal and how it was saved)
  -deleting games in localStorage will break the app if users isn't also deleted

Known Quirks-----------------
  -since users can change username and email, the user has to know the current username or email in order to get results (would have to keep track user username changes on A# maj bridge to remedy )


Components:
  1. UserInputs (inputs for username and email, input for filter before and filter after (three ways to use: get games before date, after date, or between dates), dropdown to select nth page to view when more than specified-amount-to-view-per-page number of games available

Optimizations------------------------------------------------------
  -need to keep track of how many times each userId is queried and use that info to remove the least queried usernames when space runs short (add a check in every localStorageManager method that saves which checks space available and basically deletes the minimal amount of 'least valuable' localStorage data as possible)
  -need a function to remove the oldest localStorageUser by last access date and call when storage is full or approaching it


Prettification-------------------
  -game-detail__score width is a bit 'off'
  -bolden the high cards ("A, k q j") in table
  -use deals-list dealResults to change deal-detail table username color (winners = green and losers = red)
  -change deal-detail__summary-text to red or green depending on if declarer won it.

Todos----------------------------------------------------------
  -figure out how to move landing service validators to a new service folder in the frontend project in a ValidatorsService file




-figure out how to make closing deal-player reset everything
-add goto nth card played text box?

Testing------------
  -test already stored LocalStorageUser scenario works
  -how does providing email to a localStorageUser already present work? does it save email?



-add animations/transitions for things like fade in of filters and games?

-add 'Deal Pass out' filter?

-refactor game private methods to service
-add close of deal-player when clicking on 'background' of it

-change transform location for filters animation below layout-breakpoint
