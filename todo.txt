Desired Flow:
  1. get user ID from local storage if available otherwise from mongodb atlas server and then store in local storage
      (the function that retrieves the user ID from atlas can accept either an email or username: '/api/getId?name=...' or 'api/getId?email=...'
  2. user id is used to retrieve the 10 most recent games that user has played (store games in local storage with key being iso date)
  3. deal info is fetched when user clicks 'load' next to the deal they want to load in the DealList
  * include a game summary containing relavent game info
  * display all relevant details of the game in an expanding box within the game's deal list (maybe make game's deal list a table?)
  *Would need to mkake a query that has the total number of games that user has for pagination purposes (then store in local storage);  Maybe can make one query that does that and gets the first page of game?


Components:
  1. PageContainer
  2. UserInputs (inputs for username and email, input for filter before and filter after (three ways to use: get games before date, after date, or between dates), dropdown to select nth page to view when more than specified-amount-to-view-per-page number of games available
  3. GameList (displays the list of games and makes request regarding games to backend)
  3.1. GameDetail (dumb component that has Input() of game and a template for the game)
  4. DealList (each GameDetail has one DealList;  displays the list of deals for a game and makes requests regarding deals to backend)
  4.1. DealDetail (dumb component that has Input() of deal and a template for the deal)


NgRx:
  gamesReducer, dealsReducer, 
  getGames, getGame, getDeals, getDeal


-landing reset button is messed up (disabled when valid email and no username for example)
-Add threejs nebular to landing
-add ngIf to email and username fields (hide the other if one is valid)
-figure out how to move landing service validators to a new service folder in the frontend project in a ValidatorsService file
-need to immediately process games on receipt and store deals as well.
-figure out how to efficiently store games and retrieve games (need to dispatch setGames)
