Components:
  1. UserInputs (inputs for username and email, input for filter before and filter after (three ways to use: get games before date, after date, or between dates), dropdown to select nth page to view when more than specified-amount-to-view-per-page number of games available

Optimizations------------------------------------------------------
  -store the gamecount for the user and see if it matches the stored value, if so then no need to pull any more, if not, pull and store all games in localstorage?
  -figure out how to sensibly cache looked up games into local storage and then when making new requests, check last search date for that userId/email and send a request to only get games since that date. 
    -could have localStorage item 'queriesByName' and 'queriesByEmail: 
    {
      'username' : {
        date: Date.now(),
        games: localStorage.getItem('games')[username]
      }
    }
    (need both email and username versions?)
    {
      'email' : {
        date: Date.now(),
        games: localStorage.getItem('games')[username]
      }
    }
    -then have a separate games item where the actual games are stored:
    {
      'username': Game[]
    }
  -cache looked up deals (executed in DealsList) in a similar fashion
  -cache userObjs too (have to get 4 for each game)

Prettification-------------------
  -game-detail__score width is a bit 'off'
  -bolden the high cards ("A, k q j") in table
  -use deals-list dealResults to change deal-detail table username color (winners = green and losers = red)
  -change deal-detail__summary-text to red or green depending on if declarer won it.

Todos----------------------------------------------------------
  -landing reset button is messed up (disabled when valid email and no username for example)
  -Add threejs nebular to landing
  -add ngIf to email and username fields (hide the other if one is valid)
  -figure out how to move landing service validators to a new service folder in the frontend project in a ValidatorsService file

  Game Filtering stuff----------------------------------------
  -add filter by room name option for the GameList
  -add sorting options for gameslist (ascending / descending by date and name)
  -add show games between date
  -add show games played with another player or players


-south is drawn funny y-wise on resize sometimes (no reason for it though...)

-add goto nth card played text box?
-this.cardsPlayed could contain "N/A" indicating where claim all was made
-clicking "Watch replay" for one deal then doing it for another (only on first load) causes problems (reset card rotations on "watch replay" click)
